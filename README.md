## Overview

This is a recreation of the game named Square Bird. Itâ€™s a two-dimension side-scrolling game with your main character being a square bird. 

## Instructions

To play, press the spacebar to start the game. Continue pressing the spacebar to make stacks of squares beneath the bird and as the game progresses, you will be using the squares created to get over obstacles. The score will be recorded on the top right corner of the screen. There's a probability of the squares in the stack turning red and this means that it's going to disappear afterwards, making the stack shorter. After the game ends, press the enter/return key to restart. The highest score, which will also be on the top right corner, will be recording from the previous rounds.
